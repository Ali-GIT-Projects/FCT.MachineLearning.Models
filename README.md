Machine Learning Models
This repository contains a collection of machine learning models that I have implemented and used. The models include and more:

Support vector machines (SVC): SVC is a supervised learning algorithm that can be used for both classification and regression tasks.
XGBoost: XGBoost is a gradient boosting framework that can be used for both classification and regression tasks.
Random forests: Random forests are an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to make predictions.
K-nearest neighbors (KNN): KNN is a non-parametric algorithm that classifies new data points based on the k most similar data points in the training set.
Decision trees: Decision trees are a supervised learning algorithm that can be used for both classification and regression tasks.
The models in this repository have been implemented using the Python programming language. The models are also accompanied by Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate how to use the models.
